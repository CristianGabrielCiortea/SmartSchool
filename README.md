User Roles:

Student: Students have the ability to view their own grades and attendance records, allowing them to track their academic progress and attendance history.

Teacher: Teachers can not only access their students' profiles and attendance records but also have the privilege to add grades and mark attendance for the classes they teach. This empowers them to efficiently manage their courses and provide timely feedback to students.
